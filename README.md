## ðŸ¦„ About The Monicorns

Welcome to a place where the asphalt burns with skateboards and the air is filled with dreams â€” this is the Monicorns family.

The idea of Monicorns came from a simple thought: what if you combine ponies, magic, and the streets? Out of that spark, a whole concept was born. Monicorns were created not with the goal of making just another NFT, but to build a movement and go through the process of forming an entire community.
